Types of NoSQL databases

- Types of NoSQL Databases
- Mongo Queries
    - CRUD operations
    - query embedded / nested documents
    - query array documents
    - query array of embedded documents
    - projection ( $, elemMatch, slice )
    - query null or missing fields
    - [query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/#std-label-query-selectors)
        - Comparison ( $eq, $gt, $gte, $in, $lt, $lte, $ne, $nin )
        - Logical  ( $and, $not, $nor, $or )
        - Array ( all, elemMatch, size )
        - Evaluation ( expr, regex, where )
        - geospatial ( bonus )
        - element (exists, type )
- Aggregation Operations
    - understanding aggregation pipeline
        An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more [stages](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference) 
        that process documents:
        - Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. 
          For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.
        - The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
        - An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. 
          For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.
        - limitations of aggregation
        - diskUsage
        - **Memory Restrictions**
    - match
    - group
    - buckets
    - count
    - graphLookup
    - geoNear
    - limit
    - skip
    - sort
    - sortByCount
    - out
    - project
    - set
    - unset
    - unwind
    - findAndModify
- Indexing
    - use mongo Compass to show GUI
    - single index
    - compound index
    - how does query engine decide to select index A, B, C
    - how does compound index work
    - B+ trees database
- GeoSpatial queries
