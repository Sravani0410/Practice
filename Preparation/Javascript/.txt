    *In JavaScript, the value of this is determined by how a function is called. 
    *It refers to the object on which a function is invoked.
    *The value of this can vary based on the context in which the function is called, such as object method invocation, explicit binding using call() or apply(), or when using the new keyword.
    example:
    var person = {
    name: 'John',
    sayHello: function () {
        console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
    }
    };
    person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John

    function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
    }
    var john = { name: 'John' };
    greet.call(john); // Output: Hello, John

    function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }
    var john = new Person('John');
    console.log(john.name); // Output: John

8.What are some ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?
    *Callback functions: Pass a function as an argument to another function, which will be called once the asynchronous operation completes.
    *Promises: Use the Promise object to handle asynchronous operations and chain multiple operations together.
    *Async/await: Use the async keyword to define an asynchronous function, and await to pause the execution until a promise is resolved or rejected.
    *Event emitters: Utilize event-driven patterns where events are emitted when an asynchronous operation completes, and listeners handle those events.
9.How would you compare two JavaScript objects for equality?
    *By default, comparing two JavaScript objects using == or === will check if they reference the same object in memory, rather than comparing their contents.
    *To compare objects by their values, you can use libraries like Lodash or implement a custom deep equality check by recursively comparing each property and value.
    example:
    var obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    var obj2 = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    _.isEqual(obj1, obj2); // Output: true

10.Explain the concept of lexical scoping in JavaScript.
   simple:
   =======
    *Lexical scoping is a way of resolving variables based on their position in the source code.
    *It determines the scope of a variable by where it is defined.
    *In JavaScript, functions create a new scope, and variables defined within that function are only accessible within that function and any nested functions.
    *Variables defined in an outer scope are also accessible within inner scopes, but the reverse is not true. 
    *This behavior is called lexical scoping or static scoping.
   detailed:
   ========
   Lexical scoping, also known as static scoping, is a concept in JavaScript that determines how variable names are resolved at compile time based on their lexical (static) position in the source code.
   It means that the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the code structure, specifically where it is defined.
   In lexical scoping, when a function is defined, it captures and creates a closure over the variables in its outer scope. 
   This means that the function has access to the variables in its parent scope, even if it is called from a different location within the code.
   example:
   ========
    function outer() {
    var outerVar = 'I am outside!';
    function inner() {
        var innerVar = 'I am inside!';
        console.log(outerVar + ' ' + innerVar);
    }
    inner(); // Output: I am outside! I am inside!
    }
    outer();
    *In the example above, the inner function is defined within the outer function. 
    *It forms a closure that captures the outerVar variable from its parent scope.
    *When inner is called, it has access to both the outerVar and innerVar variables. 
    *This is possible due to lexical scoping, as the variables are resolved based on their position in the code.
    *If we were to call the inner function from outside the outer function, it would result in an error because the outerVar variable would be out of scope:
        function outer() {
        var outerVar = 'I am outside!';
        }
        outer();
        inner(); // Error: inner is not defined
    *In this case, the inner function is not lexically within the scope of the outer function, so it cannot access the outerVar variable.
    *Lexical scoping plays a crucial role in JavaScript's scoping rules and enables the concept of closures, allowing functions to maintain access to variables from their parent scope even after the parent function has completed execution.
