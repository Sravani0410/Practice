Here some questions to ponder on till then

- **What is non-blocking vs blocking?**
    
    In Node.js, blocking and non-blocking behavior is determined by how I/O operations are handled
    
    ### NON-BLOCKING
    
    - By default, Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, where I/O operations are performed asynchronously without blocking the main thread of execution.
    - This means that when an I/O operation is executed, the program continues to execute other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
    - This non-blocking behavior is achieved through the use of :
        - callbacks,
        - promises, and
        - async/await functions.
    
    ### BLOCKING
    
    - Blocking behavior can occur when using certain synchronous I/O methods in Node.js.
    - Synchronous methods block the main thread until the operation is completed, preventing the program from executing any other tasks until the operation is finished.
    - This can lead to delays and decreased performance if many synchronous I/O operations need to be executed.
