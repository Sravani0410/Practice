1. What are the different data types present in javascript?
2. Explain Hoisting in javascript.
3. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
    The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code. 
    Built-in debuggers may be switched on and off, requiring the user to report faults. 
    The remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next line while debugging.
4. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
    Both are comparison operators. 
    The difference between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and types.
    var x = 2;
    var y = "2";
    (x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
    (x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"
5. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.
   Refer var,let,const folder
6.Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
  Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another. 
  It takes place when the operands of an expression are of different data types.
  *String coercion:
     String coercion takes place while using the ‘ + ‘ operator. 
     When a number is added to a string, the number type is always converted to the string type.
