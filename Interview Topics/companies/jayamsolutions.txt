15. in mongodb what are db commands are there?
    In MongoDB, there are various commands that you can use to interact with databases. These commands are typically used in the MongoDB shell or through a MongoDB driver in a programming language. Here are some of the common database-related commands in MongoDB:

        Use Database:

        use <database_name>: Switches to the specified database or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.
        Show Databases:

        show dbs: Lists all available databases on the MongoDB server.
        Show Collections:

        show collections: Lists all collections in the currently selected database.
        Create Collection:

        db.createCollection("<collection_name>"): Creates a new collection in the current database.
        Drop Collection:

        db.<collection_name>.drop(): Deletes the specified collection and all its documents.
        Insert Document:

        db.<collection_name>.insert(<document>): Inserts a document into the specified collection.
        Find Documents:

        db.<collection_name>.find(<query>): Retrieves documents from the collection based on the specified query.
        Update Documents:

        db.<collection_name>.update(<query>, <update>): Updates documents in the collection based on the specified query.
        Delete Documents:

        db.<collection_name>.remove(<query>): Removes documents from the collection based on the specified query.
        Index Management:

        db.<collection_name>.createIndex(<index_spec>): Creates an index on the specified fields in the collection.
        db.<collection_name>.getIndexes(): Lists all indexes on the collection.
        Aggregation Framework:

        MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework for data transformation and analysis. Commands like db.<collection_name>.aggregate(<pipeline>) are used for this purpose.
        Authentication:

        db.auth(<username>, <password>): Authenticates the current session against a MongoDB database.
        These are just a few examples, and MongoDB provides a rich set of commands for various operations. The MongoDB documentation is a valuable resource for exploring and learning more about the available commands: MongoDB Documentation.
