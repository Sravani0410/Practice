1. what is React?
    -React is the open source frontend javascript libarary used for building user interface for singfle web page application
    -major features are:
       -it uses virtual dom instead of using the real dom for manipulation which make a application run much smoother
       and faster and it supports server side rendering
       - it follws unidirectional data and it allows us to create reusable module. 
         so application developement is much faster

2. what is virtual dom and how it works?
    - v-dom is exact same as real dom we can say light representation of real dom.
    - v-dom cannot directly change but real dom can change directly.
    - whenever there is a change in a component or
     there is chain in corpaorte state in a componnet or diffing alogorithm to run an comparsion done between real dom and v-dom and only the updated the changed components
